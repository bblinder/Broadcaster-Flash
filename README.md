A Broadcaster v1 reflash tool

Requires the use of a SSH keyfile (if you do not know what SSH is, briefly read up on it before proceeding.)
If you do not have the keyfile on your system, please obtain one from Henry, Brandon, or Ronald.

To use the Tool, simply double-click on the file/script called `broadcaster-flash` -- or run it from its own directory by executing:


`./broadcaster-flash`

(If on Mac OS X, you may need to authenticate the script via your Mac's security and privacy settings)

What you should see:

`Please enter the public-facing IP address of the Broadcaster you'll be flashing :`

Once you've entered the public-facing IP address of the unit, press ENTER.

What you should see:

`Attempting to connect via TCP 22...`
